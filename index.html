  <div class="item3"><h1>Hello Welcome to Nutscense</h1>
<p> The idea behind this site came from my love for peanuts. As a child, my favorite snack was nuts.
    It is so fun to have a handful of nuts. The variety of nuts is another aspect that
    makes them delicious and fun to eat. What other way to express my love for this 
    snack than to offer a variety of them to the world.
<p>As a start-up company, we are currently updating our site with our products.
      Overtime, there will be a full extended list of nuts from which you can
      select from.</p>
